## Overview
Portfolio website built using HTML5, CSS3, and JS to showcase my UI/UX + product design skills coupled with my front-end abilities. Yes, I know how to use both React and React.js. This website does not use the former, as it is not a mobile app. It does not use the latter either, as React.js suppressed and hindered the distinct branding of the site.

## Built With
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JS
* Former iterations also included use of [Processing.js](https://processing.org/)

## Features
* [Vanilla JS Lightbox](https://fslightbox.com/javascript)
* Interactive CSS and Javascript
